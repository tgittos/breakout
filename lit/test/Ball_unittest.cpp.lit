== Ball Unit Tests ==
These are unit tests for the Ball class in the game.
They test the required behavior of the ball to ensure
that the logic behind the game is correct.

Each of the tests should be relatively straight
forward, so the documentation on them will not be
as explanatory as the documentation on the code.

== Ball has both Collidable and Dimension features ==
-
TEST(BallTest, FeatureTest) {
  ASSERT_FALSE(true);
}
-

== Ball reflects properly ==
-
TEST(BallTest, BrickReflection) {
  ASSERT_FALSE(true);
}
-

== Ball cannot reflect from wall at an angle that would cause it to oscillate ==
-
TEST(BallTest, NoOscillation) {
  ASSERT_FALSE(true);
}
-

== Includes ==

#include "gtest/gtest.h"
