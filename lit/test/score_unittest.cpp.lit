== Score Unit Tests ==
These are unit tests for the Score class in the game.
They test the required behavior of the score to ensure
that the logic behind the game is correct.

Each of the tests should be relatively straight
forward, so the documentation on them will not be
as explanatory as the documentation on the code.

== Score listens to brick hit events ==
-
TEST(ScoreTest, ListensForBrickHitEvents) {
  ASSERT_FALSE(true);
}
-

== Score increments by brick value when handling brick hit events ==
-
TEST(ScoreTest, IncrementsScore) {
  ASSERT_FALSE(true);
}
